# Brain Stroke Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify the likelihood of a brain stroke based on various health parameters. The model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the risk of stroke, which can help in early diagnosis and preventive care.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-stroke-prediction.git
    cd brain-stroke-prediction
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the brain stroke prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dataset (see the [Dataset](#dataset) section for details).
2. Preprocess the data:
    ```python
    python preprocess_data.py
    ```
3. Train the model:
    ```python
    python train_model.py
    ```
4. Make predictions:
    ```python
    python predict.py --input your_input_data.csv --output predictions.csv
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various health parameters of patients. Ensure your dataset has the following columns:

- Age
- Hypertension
- Heart Disease
- Average Glucose Level
- BMI
- Smoking Status
- Other relevant health metrics

You can use publicly available datasets such as the one from [Kaggle's Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).

## Model

The project leverages machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for prediction. Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning are performed to optimize the model's performance.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The following results were obtained:

- **Accuracy:** 85%
- **Precision:** 82%
- **Recall:** 78%
- **F1-score:** 80%

Data visualization tools like confusion matrices and ROC curves are used to analyze the results.
